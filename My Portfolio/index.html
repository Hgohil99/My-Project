    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a System Engineer at Infosys, driven by a commitment to innovation, technical growth, and collaboration. With over two years of experience, I specialize in designing, deploying, and managing REST APIs and cloud-based solutions, integrating advanced skills in MuleSoft, AWS, Kubernetes, Python, and MySQL. My professional journey is defined by a dedication to expanding my technical knowledge and delivering high-quality solutions that align with client and business objectives.
    
    I thrive in environments that foster creativity and continuous learning, consistently pursuing certifications to refine my expertise in cutting-edge technologies. My certifications from Salesforce and AWS, as well as my specialization in API and microservices architecture, cloud computing, and cybersecurity foundations, enable me to address complex technical challenges with a structured and solutions-oriented approach.
        
    Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong ability to collaborate across functions and disciplines, ensuring cohesive and effective outcomes for large-scale projects. I am passionate about leveraging technology to innovate, streamline processes, and enhance user experiences, and I look forward to contributing my skills to projects that challenge and inspire growth.</p>
